# Backbone collection iterator v0.1

Simple prev and next functionality on a backbone collection

## Usage

Include backbone-collection-iterator.js after having included backbone.js:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="backbone-collection-iterator.js"></script>

Given a model in a collection, get the prev or next based on the insertion order:

    nextmodel = someCollection.prev(model);
    prevmodel = someCollection.next(model);
